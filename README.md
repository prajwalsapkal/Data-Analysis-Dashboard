# Data-Analysis-Dashboard
I developed a comprehensive project by generating data in Python, then using Excel to create multiple dashboards and tables to analyze the data. This process involved several stages, including data preprocessing, data cleaning, and data visualization.

Data Analysis Dashboard (Sales Performance)
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analysis pipeline using Python for data simulation and Excel for powerful, interactive dashboard creation.

Tools & Technologies Used:
Python (PyCharm IDE)
Generated realistic synthetic data using pandas, numpy, random, and faker libraries to simulate sales performance across multiple employees and regions.

Microsoft Excel
Performed data preprocessing, cleaning, and visualization using Excel features like pivot tables, pivot charts, slicers, and interactive buttons.

Project Overview:
The dataset contains:

Employee codes and names

Sales performance for Days 1–5

Total Sales, Targets, Target Hit %, and Away From Target %

Dashboard Design & Functionality:
The Excel file features four linked dashboards:

Dashboard 1 – Top Performers
Displays the Top 5 Sales Executives based on total sales, visualized using pivot charts.

Dashboard 2 – Bottom Performers
Shows the Bottom 5 Sales Executives based on total sales.

Dashboard 3 – Target Hit %
Ranks sales executives by how close they came to achieving or exceeding their targets, represented as Target Hit % using pivot charts.

Dashboard 4 – Away From Target %
Visualizes the percentage gap between actual performance and target for each executive, using pivot charts.

Features:
Region-Based Filters using slicers
Interactive dashboard switching via buttons and logic-based linking
Clean layout with separate sections for each analysis
Effective visual storytelling through bar, pie, and column charts

What I Learned:
Data generation and structuring in Python
Advanced Excel techniques: pivot tables, slicers, conditional formatting
Dashboard logic linking via formula-based or macro-enabled buttons
Presenting business metrics through visual analytics
